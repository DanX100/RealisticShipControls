## Features
The mod adds 4 control modes for the pilot:  
1. Full assist. In this mode, the ship is controlled as before, slowing down and stopping rotation when the engines are turned off.
2. Angular only. In this mode, the ship does not slow down, but slows down the rotation.
3. Linear only. In this mode, the ship does not stop rotating, but the movement slows down.
4. Disable. In this mode, all stabilizations are disabled and the ship behaves like a cosmic body.
